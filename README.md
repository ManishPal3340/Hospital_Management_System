The Hospital Management System is a simple web-based application designed to streamline basic hospital operations such as administrator login and appointment scheduling. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this system provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to securely log in and manage appointment records. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how front-end technologies can be used to create an organized and responsive system that improves efficiency in handling patient interactions and hospital workflows.

The admin in the Hospital Management System serves as the primary authority responsible for managing and overseeing hospital operations within the platform. After logging in through a secure interface, the admin gains access to a dashboard where they can view, schedule, edit, and delete patient appointments. Their role includes maintaining accurate patient records, organizing doctorsâ€™ availability, and ensuring the system runs smoothly and securely. Additionally, the admin monitors system activity, handles user access, and updates key information as needed. This centralized control ensures that hospital tasks are efficiently managed and that patient care processes are well-coordinated.

In the Hospital Management System, the user typically refers to a patient or visitor who interacts with the platform to access healthcare services. Users can visit the appointment page to fill out and submit appointment requests by providing their name, preferred date, and time for consultation. Their main task is to schedule appointments with doctors, and in a more advanced system, they may also view appointment history, receive confirmation notifications, or update personal details. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, ensuring that patients can easily access the care they need without requiring technical knowledge.

The appointment module in the Hospital Management System allows users (patients) to conveniently book medical consultations online. Through a simple form, patients can enter their name, select a preferred date and time, and submit the request. These details are then recorded and made accessible to the admin, who can manage and organize upcoming appointments efficiently. The system is designed to reduce manual scheduling, minimize booking conflicts, and ensure that each appointment is properly tracked. In an advanced version, the appointment system could include features like doctor selection, appointment status updates, and reminders for both patients and staff.
